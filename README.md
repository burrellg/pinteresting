# One Month Rails

Sample app "Pinteresting" for [*One Month Rails*]
(http://onemonthrails.com)

This is the stepping off point from which I make a
concerted effort to learn a programming language.
This is a new way I will empower myself and reduce
the amount I rely on others to succeed.

The amount of time I put into this now will equal 
the amount of reward I get when I start taking on 
projects.  If I can commit to finishing this program 
in a short time, I will be able to start a portfolio 
that could net me work before Christmas.
